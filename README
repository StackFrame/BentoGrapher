This is a quick hack for making charts with Bento. (Bento is a trademark of
FileMaker, Inc.)

Bento has no charting capability, so this reaches into the Bento database and
builds charts from selected fields. It is very crude and just a quick hack. I
might develop this some more to make it smarter and easier to use.
